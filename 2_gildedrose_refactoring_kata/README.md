# Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata

You can find out more about this exercise in my YouTube video [Why Developers LOVE The Gilded Rose Kata](https://youtu.be/Mt4XpGxigT4). I also have a video of a worked solution in Java - [Gilded Rose Kata, Hands-on](https://youtu.be/OdnV8hc9L7I)

I use this kata as part of my work as a technical coach. I wrote a lot about the coaching method I use in this book [Technical Agile Coaching with the Samman method](https://leanpub.com/techagilecoach). A while back I wrote this article ["Writing Good Tests for the Gilded Rose Kata"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/03/writing-good-tests-for-the-gilded-rose-kata/) about how you could use this kata in a [coding dojo](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).


## How to use this Kata

The simplest way is to just clone the code and start hacking away improving the design. You'll want to look at the ["Gilded Rose Requirements"](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/main/GildedRoseRequirements.md) which explains what the code is for. I strongly advise you that you'll also need some tests if you want to make sure you don't break the code while you refactor.

You could write some unit tests yourself, using the requirements to identify suitable test cases. I've provided a failing unit test in a popular test framework as a starting point for most languages.

Alternatively, use the Approval tests provided in this repository. (Read more about that in the section "Text-based Approval Testing").

The idea of the exercise is to do some deliberate practice, and improve your skills at designing test cases and refactoring. The idea is not to re-write the code from scratch, but rather to practice taking small steps, running the tests often, and incrementally improving the design. 

## Text-Based Approval Testing

Most language versions of this code have a [TextTest](https://texttest.org) fixture for Approval testing. For information about this, see the [TextTests README](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/texttests)
